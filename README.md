An advanced AI-powered autonomous drone system designed to revolutionize agricultural pollination for pumpkin farms in Sri Lanka and similar tropical regions. This system addresses critical challenges of manual pollination including labor intensity, timing precision, pollinator decline, and climate variability.

1. Overview

This project implements an intelligent autonomous drone system capable of identifying, navigating to, and pollinating pumpkin flowers with precision timing. The system uses computer vision, artificial intelligence, and precision agriculture techniques to achieve up to 15% yield improvement over manual pollination methods.
Problem Statement
Pumpkin cultivation faces several critical challenges:

Short receptivity window: Flowers are receptive for only 4-6 hours
Labor intensity: Manual pollination is time-consuming and error-prone
Pollinator decline: Natural bee populations are declining globally
Climate variability: Unpredictable weather affects pollination timing
Scalability: Manual methods don't scale for large farms

2. Key Features
Autonomous Navigation

RTK-GPS enabled precision positioning (±2cm)
Waypoint-based flight planning
Real-time obstacle avoidance
Automatic return-to-home on low battery
Geofencing for safe operation zones

AI-Powered Flower Detection

YOLOv8-based object detection model
Male/female flower classification
Receptivity assessment using visual cues
3D position calculation with depth sensing
Processing speed: 60fps @ 1080p

Smart Pollination

Two pollination methods:

Brush-based: Servo-controlled mechanical arm with soft bristles
Contactless: Charged particle or soap bubble delivery


Real-time mechanism adjustment
Pollen level monitoring
Success rate tracking

Data Intelligence

GPS-tagged pollination events
Environmental condition logging (temp, humidity, light)
Historical pattern analysis
Yield prediction algorithms
Field productivity heatmaps

Ground Control Station

Live video feed monitoring
Real-time telemetry dashboard
Mission planning interface
Emergency controls
Post-flight analytics and reporting
