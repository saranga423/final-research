1. Overview

The AI-Powered Adaptive Career Guidance System is a web-based platform designed to assist students, universities, and employers in bridging the gap between academic learning and industry skill demands.
It integrates AI modules, data analytics, and real-time job market intelligence to deliver personalized career recommendations and skill gap analysis.

2. Architecture Layers
Frontend (React.js)

Purpose: Provides an interactive and responsive interface for users (students, universities, and employers).

Key Features:

Student Dashboard: Displays skill analytics, job insights, and learning suggestions.

Resume Upload: Accepts resumes or LinkedIn profiles to extract existing skills.

Career Recommendations: Shows career paths, missing skills, and suggested courses.

Communication: Sends data to the backend via RESTful APIs.

Backend (FastAPI / Node.js)

Purpose: Acts as the main processing hub and API provider.

Key Modules:

User Management: Handles authentication, role-based access, and session management.

Skills & Job Management: Stores extracted skills, job data, and mapping information.

Recommendation Engine: Communicates with AI modules to generate personalized results.

Data Flow: Receives requests from the frontend → processes logic → calls AI models → returns results.

AI Modules (Python-based ML/NLP Components)

Skill Extraction Module:

Uses NLP (BERT, GPT, or SpaCy) to identify skills from resumes, profiles, or uploaded text.

Job Market Analysis Module:

Continuously monitors APIs (e.g., LinkedIn, O*NET, Kaggle datasets) for trending roles and required skills.

Dynamic Skill Gap Detector:

Compares student skill sets with job market demands to detect missing or outdated skills.

Uses Machine Learning models (SVM / Neural Networks) for accurate prediction.

Career Recommender:

Suggests suitable job roles, certifications, and learning paths using AI-based recommendation algorithms.

Database (MongoDB)

Purpose: Stores user data, skill profiles, job market data, and AI results.

Data Types:

User Profiles (students, universities, employers)

Skill Repositories

Job Trends & Requirements

Recommendation Histories

Reason for MongoDB: Flexible schema for evolving AI outputs and rapid prototyping.

External Data Sources

APIs Integrated:

LinkedIn Jobs API – Real-time job postings and required skills.

O*NET Database – Occupational data and skill taxonomies.

Kaggle / WEF datasets – Market and skill demand trends.

Security & Ethics

Implements JWT-based authentication, data anonymization, and GDPR-compliance.

Ensures ethical AI decision-making — transparency, fairness, and explainability.

3. Data Flow Summary

Student logs in and uploads resume → Frontend sends data to Backend API.

Backend triggers AI skill extraction module → identifies skills and stores them in the database.

Job market data is fetched from APIs and analyzed via Job Market Module.

Skill Gap Detector compares student skills vs. job requirements → outputs missing skills.

Career Recommender suggests personalized paths, shown in the Dashboard UI.

4. Deployment

Frontend: Deployed on Vercel / Netlify.

Backend + AI modules: Deployed using Docker + Render / AWS EC2.

Database: Hosted on MongoDB Atlas for scalability.
